Text Scrambler — Usage Instructions

    Prepare Your Text Layer

        Create or select a Text layer in your composition.

    Add Expression Controls
    On that same layer, apply three sliders via Effect → Expression Controls → Slider Control:

        Speed

            Controls how fast the effect plays (units ≈ loops per second).

        Direction

            Rename this Slider to Animation Mode (1=Left→Right; 2=Right→Left; 3=Random; 4=Ping-Pong)

            Set its Min = 1, Max = 4, Step = 1.

        Loop Duration

            How many seconds each cycle lasts (minimum 0.001).

    Paste the Expression

        Twirl open Text → Source Text on your layer.

        Alt-click (Option-click on Mac) the stopwatch icon next to Source Text.

        Delete any existing code and paste the full Text Scrambler expression.

    Adjust Parameters

        Speed: higher values → faster scrambling.

        Animation Mode: choose 1–4 to switch between:

            Left→Right (region-based glitch moving left to right)

            Right→Left (same, reversed)

            Random (uniform glitch across all characters)

            Ping-Pong (two glitch-blocks scanning back and forth)

        Loop Duration: length of one full cycle in seconds.

    Fine-Tuning

        Tweak Speed vs. Loop Duration to get the right pacing.

        Increase Event Probability (eventProb1 in code) for more frequent single-character glitches in modes 1–2.

        If you want to expand the effect (more modes, different block sizes), simply edit the expression’s parameters.

    Reuse as a Preset

        Select the three controls (Speed, Direction slider, Source Text).

        Go to Animation → Save Animation Preset…, name it Text Scrambler, and save.

        Later, apply Text Scrambler from Effects & Presets → Animation Presets → User Presets to any other text layer in any project.
